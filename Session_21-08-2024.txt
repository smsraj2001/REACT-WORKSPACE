Nowadays we are transitioning from multi-page website to single page application. (SPA)
Multi-page website will load multiple times for different pages, but SPA will load only once and it will load the data dynamically.

Commands:
---------
npx create-react-app myfirstapp (It comes with boilerplate code and project structure.)

React JS:
---------
- By using react we can create a single page application. (SPA)
- ReactJS is a LIBRARY for building user interfaces.
- ReactJS is developed by Facebook.
- ReactJS is an open source library.
- ReactNative is a framework for building mobile applications.
- Main feature of ReactJS is Virtual DOM. (Document Object Model)
- React is component based library.
- React UI is built with a collection of components. (header component, footer component, aside component, section component, etc.)
- If any change happens in the component, then only that component will be re-loaded, not the entire page.


What is framework?
------------------
- Framework is a collection of libraries which are readymade.
- AngualrJS is a framework, but ReactJS is a library.

Difference between library and framework:
----------------------------------------

Library:                                               Framework:
--------                                               ----------
- Library is a collection of functions.                - Framework is a collection of libraries.
- We can use the functions of library whenever we      - We can use the libraries of framework whenever
  want.                                                   we want.
- Library is small in size.                            - Framework is large in size.
- Example: ReactJS is a library.                        - Example: AngularJS is a framework.

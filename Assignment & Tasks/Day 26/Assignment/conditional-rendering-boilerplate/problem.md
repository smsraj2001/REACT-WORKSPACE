- Follow the instruction in each `.js` file in components folder to complete the assignment

## Background
- A component named `ConditionRender1.js` takes in array of names as props value and prints the same in form of list, And also should fetche the first name (Zeroth element) from array and display the same as `First Person:Alpha`
- If the array is empty, then the component should display message `No Contact Details Found!!`
- Else if the array is undefined, then the component should display message `No Contact Details Found!!`

- A component named `ConditionReender2.js` takes in a value `loggedIn` as either true or false.
- If `loggedIn` value is set to true, then component has to display `Hello Alpha!!`
- If `loggedIn` value is set to true, then component has to display `Please login to continue!!`
